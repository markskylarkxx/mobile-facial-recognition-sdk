# mobile-facial-recognition-sdk

 This SDK provides a robust and efficient solution for integrating facial recognition capabilities into mobile applications. It's designed for high performance on resource-constrained devices, offering features like real-time face detection, recognition, and liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks

 Features
 Real-time Face Detection: Accurately detects faces in video streams or static images.

 Facial Recognition: Identifies individuals by comparing detected faces against a pre-enrolled database.

 Liveness Detection / Anti-Spoofing: Verifies that a real, live person is present, mitigating risks from photos, videos, or masks.

 Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed for seamless integration on both Android and iOS platforms.

 Optimized Performance: Leverages native device capabilities for fast and efficient processing.

 Architecture & Components

 The SDK is structured into several key components to ensure modularity, performance, and ease of integration:

 Core Recognition Engine (C++):

 The heart of the SDK, implemented in highly optimized C++.

 Handles all the heavy lifting: neural network inference for detection, recognition, and liveness.

 Platform-agnostic, ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems.

 Utilizes optimized libraries for matrix operations and deep learning inference (TFLite).

 Platform Abstraction Layer (C++/JNI/Objective-C++):

 Provides a bridge between the native C++ core and the platform-specific UI layers.

 Manages camera access, image buffer handling, and threading for optimal performance on each mobile OS.

 Android SDK (Java/Kotlin):

 A high-level API for Android developers to easily integrate the SDK.

 Includes UI components (e.g., custom camera view, overlay for face bounding boxes) and lifecycle management.

 Handles permissions, camera preview, and callbacks from the native core via JNI.

 iOS SDK (Objective-C/Swift):

 A high-level API for iOS developers.

 Provides similar UI components and integration points as the Android SDK, tailored for the iOS ecosystem.

 Communicates with the native core via Objective-C++.

 Building the SDK with CMake
 This section outlines the steps to compile the native C++ components of the SDK using CMake.

 rerequisites

  Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  CMake: Version 3.10 or higher.
  OpenCV
  
  C++ Compiler:

    Android: Android NDK (typically comes with Android Studio).

   iOS/macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools.

 Git: For cloning the repository.

 Compilation Steps

  Steps to build the native libraries:

  1,=.Clone the Repository:
  First, clone the SDK repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/your-org/mobile-facial-recognition-sdk.git
  cd mobile-facial-recognition-sdk

  2.Create a Build Directory:
  It's best practice to build out-of-source. Create a build directory:

   mkdir build
   cd build

  3.Configure CMake:
  Run CMake to configure the project. The command will vary slightly depending on your target platform.

  For Android (ARM64-v8a target, adjust for other ABIs if needed):
  You'll need to specify the Android NDK path and the target ABI.
  
  cmake .. \
 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
 -DANDROID_ABI="arm64-v8a" \
 -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-21 \
 -DANDROID_STL=c++_shared \
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 
 Replace $ANDROID_NDK_HOME with the actual path to your Android NDK installation.

 For iOS (Universal build for device and simulator):

 cmake .. \
 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/ios.toolchain.cmake \
 -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
 -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64" \
 -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO \
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

 or Desktop (e.g., Linux/macOS for testing):

 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 
 Build the Project:
 After successful configuration, build the project using the --build flag: 
 cmake --build . --config Release
 
 This command will compile all the native C++ components and generate the necessary static or shared libraries (.so for Android, .a for iOS)
